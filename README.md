# Multi-objective optimization  

This is the process of simultaneous optimization of two or more conflicting objective functions within a given domain of definition.  

Multi-objective optimization problems are found in many areas of science, technology and economics.  

## The formulation of the problem  

To choose the best of the alternatives for solving the proposed task of the specified criteria using the following methods:  

1. replacing criteria with constraints;  
2. formation and narrowing of the Pareto set;  
3. the method of weighing and combining criteria;  
4. the method of hierarchy analysis.
