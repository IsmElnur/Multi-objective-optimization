# Multi-objective optimization  

This is the process of simultaneous optimization of two or more conflicting objective functions within a given domain of definition.  

Multi-objective optimization problems are found in many areas of science, technology and economics.  

## The formulation of the problem  

To choose the best of the alternatives for solving the proposed task of the specified criteria using the following methods:  

1. replacing criteria with restrictions;
2. formation and narrowing of the Pareto set;  
3. method of weighing and combining criteria;  
4. hierarchy analysis method.

Choosing a university for admission:  

Alternatives:  

A. Oxford  
B. MSU  
C. MIPT  
D. TSU  

  
Description of preferences:  

1. Scholarship amount  
2. Teacher qualifications  
3. Cost of living in the city
4. Prestige of the diploma


Criteria:

1. Scholarship amount: Oxford doesn't pay scholarships to students, at the TSU the scholarship is small, at the MIPT – more, at the MSU – significantly more.  
2. Teacher qualifications: 



We compose a vector of criterion weights using a scale of 1-10.  


The algorithm for solving the multi-objective optimization problem is implemented in the Python programming language.
